# GuessingGame
A very simple guessing game.

I started creating this basic guessing game on 14th March 2023 & finished creating this on 15th March 2023.

I created this using Microsoft .NET C# as the programming language & Visual Studio 2022 version 17.5.2 as the Integrated Development Environment.

To start off, I laid a basic plan to write the program using a Console Application. 
When everything was clear to me, I designed the Graphical User Interface using Windows Forms C# Application. 
I then copied the code of the Console to the Windows Forms, made the couple necessary changes & published it using "Microsoft Single Project MSIX Tools" Extension.
